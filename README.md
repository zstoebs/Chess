# Chess
Hobby chess project started summer 2019

I'm currently redoing the architecture, implementing some GoF design patterns to modularize the app.   

The current primary dependencies for this project are C++ and its Standard Template Library.

# Current progress:
  - Most backend skeleton code, and mechanics
  - Definitions of all Pieces
  - Consolidated mechanics of pieces in Board class to avoid a circular inclusion problem

# To-do:
  - Translate
  - Defining and implementing a visual interface (planning on using OpenGL)
  - Simple testing of the backend functionality
  - Rigorous testing
  - Game driver

# Long term:
  - Networking
  - Support for tips and improvement interfaces
  - Strategy tutorials
  - Support for an AI opponent with scaling difficulties
